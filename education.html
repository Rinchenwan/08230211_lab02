        <p>Kupiyalsa Primary School is where I studied from class PP till class four.
           It holds my biggest childhood memories. I had to walk for 20 minutes to reach the school, as there was no boarding facility at all.
           Whether it was raining or sunny, I had to walk every single day(PP–4)</p>

        <img src="images/6233406287635401296.jpg" alt="Wambur Primary School">
        <p>Wambur Primary School was the place where my life changed because it was my first experience living in a boarding school. 
          At first, I had no idea how to be independent on my own, but somehow, I managed.
          If I ever got a chance to go back, I would probably choose this school because it taught me so many life lessons. Even though it was in a remote place, it was peaceful and full of memories that shaped me.(4–6)</p>

      <div class="edu-item">
        <img src="images/6233406287635401297.jpg" alt="Autsho Central School">
        <p>Autsho Central School was where I stepped into adulthood. It was here that I learned to handle everything on my own — from friendship betrayals and heartbreaks to procrastinating on homework.
          It was kind of nice in a way because these challenges helped me grow and become stronger. I also met some of my closest friends there, friends who are still with me today.(7–10)</p>

      <div class="edu-item">
        <img src="images/6233406287635401295.jpg" alt="Lhuntse Higher Secondary School">
        <p>Lhuntse Higher Secondary School was where I became a pro at skipping classes and not listening to teachers.
          At first, I wanted to take science, but unfortunately, I got placed in the arts stream. From the moment I became an arts student, my dream of becoming who I wanted to be slowly faded.
          I finished high school with many traumas and lessons learned along the way. (11–12)</p>

      <div class="edu-item">
        <img src="images/6233406287635401300.jpg" alt="Samtse College of Education">
        <p>Samtse College of Education (B.Ed IT, 3rd Year)
          Samtse College of Education felt like a blessing — I believe God heard my prayers when I got selected to study there.
          At first, I was happy, but then I found out my course was STEM-based, which was completely new to me since I had never studied it before. It was difficult at the beginning, but as time went on, I learned so much from my classmates and peers.
          I am truly thankful to everyone who kept motivating me and helped me whenever I needed support.
          There is still more to come in this journey. This is my educational life so far — my future is unknown, but I’m ready to keep going
